						C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and
						type-safe programming language. C# has its roots in the C family of
						languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and
						JavaScript programmers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Several C# features aid in the construction of robust and durable
						applications. Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory
						occupied by unreachable unused objects. Exception handling provides
						a structured and extensible approach to error detection and
						recovery. Lambda expressions support functional programming
						techniques. Query syntax creates a common pattern for working with
						data from any source. Language support for asynchronous operations
						provides syntax for building distributed systems. Pattern matching
						provides syntax to easily separate data from algorithms in modern
						distributed systems.

					<p>
						C# is an object-oriented language. Four of the key techniques used
						in object-oriented programming are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<i>Abstraction</i> means hiding the unnecessary details from type
							consumers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Encapsulation</i> means that a group of related properties,
							methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Inheritance</i> describes the ability to create new classes
							based on an existing class.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Polymorphism</i> means that you can have multiple classes that
							can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the
							same properties or methods in different ways.
						</li>

					<p>
						The &quot;Hello, World&quot; program is traditionally used to
						introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:
					</p>
					<code>
						using System;<br />
						class Hello { static void Main() { Console.WriteLine("Hello,
						World"); } }</code

				<header>Variables</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						Variables represent storage locations. Every variable has a type
						that determines what values can be stored in the variable. C# is a
						type-safe language, and the C# compiler guarantees that values
						stored in variables are always of the appropriate type
					</p>

			<section class="main-section" id="declare-assign">
				<header>Variable declaration and assignment</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						When you declare a variable or constant in a program, you must
						either specify its type or use the var keyword to let the compiler
						infer the type. The following example shows some variable
						declarations that use both built-in numeric types and complex
						user-defined types:
					</p>
					<p>
						The assignment operator = assigns the value of its right-hand
						operand to a variable, a property, or an indexer element given by
						its left-hand operand. The result of an assignment expression is the
						value assigned to the left-hand operand. The type of the right-hand
						operand must be the same as the type of the left-hand operand or
						implicitly convertible to it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following example shows some variable declarations and
						assignments:
					</p>

					<code>
						<span class="comment">//Declaration</span><br />
						float price;<br />
						string name;<br />
						boolean isReady;<br />
						<br />
						<br />
						<span class="comment">//Assignments</span><br />
						price = 36.80;<br />
						name = "John";<br />
						isReady = "true";<br />
					</code>

			<section class="main-section" id="types">
				<header>Types and variable</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						There are two kinds of types in C#: value types and reference types.
						Variables of value types directly contain their data whereas
						variables of reference types store references to their data, the
						latter being known as objects. With reference types, it's possible
						for two variables to reference the same object and possible for
						operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the
						other variable. With value types, the variables each have their own
						copy of the data, and it isn't possible for operations on one to
						affect the other (except for ref and out parameter variables).
					</p>

					<p>
						An identifier is a variable name. An identifier is a sequence of
						unicode characters without any whitespace. An identifier may be a C#
						reserved word, if it is prefixed by @. That can be useful when
						interacting with other languages.
					</p>

					<p>
						C#'s value types are further divided into simple types, enum types,
						struct types, nullable value types and tuple value types. C#'s
						reference types are further divided into class types, interface
						types, array types, and delegate types.

			<section class="main-section" id="if-else">
				<header>If- Else statement</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						An if statement identifies which statement to run based on the value
						of a Boolean expression. In the following example, the bool variable
						condition is set to true and then checked in the if statement. The
						output is The variable is set to true.
					</p>

					<code>
						bool condition = true;<br />

						if (condition)<br />
						{ <br />
						Console.WriteLine("The variable is set to true.");<br />
						}else{<br />
						Console.WriteLine("The variable is set to false.");<br />
						}<br />
					</code>
					<p>
						In an if-else statement, if condition evaluates to true, the
						then-statement runs. If condition is false, the else-statement runs.
						Because condition can’t be simultaneously true and false, the
						then-statement and the else-statement of an if-else statement can
						never both run. After the then-statement or the else-statement runs,
						control is transferred to the next statement after the if statement.
					</p>
				</article>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="while">
				<header>While statement</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						The while statement executes a statement or a block of statements
						while a specified Boolean expression evaluates to true. Because that
						expression is evaluated before each execution of the loop, a while
						loop executes zero or more times.
					</p>
					<p>
						At any point within the while statement block, you can break out of
						the loop by using the break statement.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can step directly to the evaluation of the while expression by
						using the continue statement. If the expression evaluates to true,
						execution continues at the first statement in the loop. Otherwise,
						execution continues at the first statement after the loop.
					</p>
					<code>
						int n = 0;<br />
						while (n &lt; 5)<br />
						{<br />
						Console.WriteLine(n);<br />
						n++;<br />
						}<br />
					</code>
					<p>
						In an if-else statement, if condition evaluates to true, the
						then-statement runs. If condition is false, the else-statement runs.
						Because condition can’t be simultaneously true and false, the
						then-statement and the else-statement of an if-else statement can
						never both run. After the then-statement or the else-statement runs,
						control is transferred to the next statement after the if statement.

			<section class="main-section" id="do-while">
				<header>Do - while statement</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						The do statement executes a statement or a block of statements while
						a specified Boolean expression evaluates to true. Because that
						expression is evaluated after each execution of the loop, a do-while
						loop executes one or more times. This differs from the while loop,
						which executes zero or more times.
					</p>
					<p>
						At any point within the do statement block, you can break out of the
						loop by using the break statement.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can step directly to the evaluation of the while expression by
						using the continue statement. If the expression evaluates to true,
						execution continues at the first statement in the loop. Otherwise,
						execution continues at the first statement after the loop.
					</p>
					<p>The following example shows the usage of the while statement.</p>
					<code>
						int n = 0;<br />
						do<br />
						{<br />
						Console.WriteLine(n);<br />
						n++;<br />
						} <br />
						while (n < 5);<br />

			<section class="main-section" id="switch">
				<header>Switch statement</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						Switch is a selection statement that chooses a single switch section
						to execute from a list of candidates based on a pattern match with
						the match expression.
					</p>
					<p>
						The switch statement is often used as an alternative to an if-else
						construct if a single expression is tested against three or more
						conditions
					</p>
					<code>
						using System;<br />

						public class Example{<br />
						&emsp;public static void Main(){<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;int caseSwitch = 1;<br /><br />

						&emsp;&emsp;switch (caseSwitch){<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;case 1:<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;Console.WriteLine("Case 1");<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;break;<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;case 2:<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;Console.WriteLine("Case 2");<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;break;<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;default:<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;Console.WriteLine("Default case");<br />
						&emsp;&emsp;break;}<br />
						&emsp;}<br />

			<section class="main-section" id="method">
				<header>Method</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						A method is a code block that contains a series of statements. A
						program causes the statements to be executed by calling the method
						and specifying any required method arguments. In C#, every executed
						instruction is performed in the context of a method. The Main method
						is the entry point for every C# application and it's called by the
						common language runtime (CLR) when the program is started.
					</p>
					<p>
						Methods are declared in a class, struct, or interface by specifying
						the access level such as public or private, optional modifiers such
						as abstract or sealed, the return value, the name of the method, and
						any method parameters. These parts together are the signature of the
						method.<br />Below is an example of how to create a method in C#
					</p>
					<code>
						public void StartEngine() {<span class="comment"
							>/* Method statements here */ </span
						>}<br />
					</code>

			<section class="main-section" id="class">
				<header>Class</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type.
					</p>
					<p>
						Classes are declared by using the class keyword followed by a unique
						identifier, as shown in the following example:
					</p>
					<code>
						public class Customer <br />
						{<br />
						<span class="comment"
							>// Fields, properties, methods and events go here...</span
						><br />
						}<br />
					</code>
				</article>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="objects">
				<header>Objects</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						Although they are sometimes used interchangeably, a class and an
						object are different things. A class defines a type of object, but
						it is not an object itself. An object is a concrete entity based on
						a class, and is sometimes referred to as an instance of a class.
					</p>
					<p>
						Objects can be created by using the new keyword followed by the name
						of the class that the object will be based on, like this:
					</p>
					<code> Customer object1 = new Customer(); </code>
					<p>
						When an instance of a class is created, a reference to the object is
						passed back to the programmer.
